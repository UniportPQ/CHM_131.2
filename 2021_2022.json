  },
  "Explanation": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "A system is said to be in equilibrium when its macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration, remain constant over time. Furthermore, for a system to be in equilibrium with its surroundings, there must be no net exchange of energy (like heat) or matter between them. This implies thermal equilibrium (uniform temperature throughout the system and with surroundings), mechanical equilibrium (uniform pressure, no work done on or by the surroundings), and chemical equilibrium (the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products). The absence of observable changes signifies this state of balance."

  "Answer": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "\\(Q < K\\)"
  },
  "Explanation": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "The equilibrium constant (K) represents the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations (each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient) when a reaction has reached equilibrium. The reaction quotient (Q) is calculated in the same way as K, but uses the concentrations of reactants and products at *any* given moment, not necessarily at equilibrium. If a reaction proceeds from left to right (i.e., in the forward direction) to reach equilibrium, it means the system currently has relatively more reactants and/or fewer products than it would at equilibrium. Therefore, the value of the reaction quotient Q (ratio of products to reactants) is less than the value of the equilibrium constant K. The reaction shifts right, consuming reactants and forming products, causing Q to increase until it becomes equal to K at equilibrium."

    "content": "Common ion effect"
  },
  "Explanation": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "This phenomenon is known as the common ion effect. Sparingly soluble salts establish an equilibrium in solution between the solid salt and its dissolved ions (e.g., \\(AgCl(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)\\)). According to Le Chatelier's principle, if an external stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress. If a soluble salt containing one of the ions already involved in the equilibrium (a 'common ion', like adding \\(NaCl\\) which provides \\(Cl^-\\) ions) is added to the solution, the concentration of that common ion increases. To counteract this increase, the equilibrium shifts to the left, favouring the formation of the solid salt and thus reducing the concentration of the *other* ion. This results in a lower molar solubility of the sparingly soluble salt compared to its solubility in pure water."

  "Answer": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "Rate of disappearance of B = \\(-\\frac{\\Delta[B]}{\\Delta t}\\)"
  },
    "Explanation": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "The rate of a chemical reaction describes how fast reactants are consumed or products are formed over time. For a reactant like B, its concentration decreases as the reaction progresses. The rate of disappearance of B is defined as the change in the concentration of B, \\(\\Delta[B]\\), divided by the time interval, \\(\\Delta t\\), over which the change occurs. Since the concentration of B decreases, \\(\\Delta[B] = [B]_{final} - [B]_{initial}\\) is a negative value. To express the rate as a positive quantity (as rates conventionally are), a negative sign is included in the definition: Rate of disappearance of B = \\(-\\frac{\\Delta[B]}{\\Delta t}\\). This gives the instantaneous or average rate at which the concentration of B is decreasing."

In a redox reaction, electron transfer occurs. The substance that causes another substance to be oxidized (lose electrons) must itself accept those electrons. By accepting electrons, this substance undergoes reduction. Therefore, the species that facilitates the oxidation of another substance is called an oxidizing agent (or oxidant). Conversely, a substance that causes another to be reduced (gain electrons) is a reducing agent (or reductant) and is itself oxidized."

In the context of the Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory (where acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors), such a substance is specifically called amphiprotic. Amphiprotic species can donate a proton (act as an acid) in one reaction and accept a proton (act as a base) in another. A common example is water (H₂O), which can donate a proton to form OH⁻ or accept a proton to form H₃O⁺. Other examples include the bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻) and amino acids. While 'amphiprotic' specifically refers to proton transfer, 'amphoteric' is a slightly broader term that includes Lewis acid/base behavior as well, but they are often used interchangeably for substances like water."

Volume of Cl₂ = (moles of Cl₂) × (molar volume at STP) = \\(7.461\\ mol \\times 22.4\\ L/mol \\approx 167.1\\ L\\). Rounding to 3 significant figures gives 167 L Cl₂ (at STP)."

  "Explanation": {
    "type": "string",
    "content": "To calculate the concentration of a reactant remaining after a certain time, we need the integrated rate law, which depends on the order of the reaction. The order is not explicitly stated, but the units of the rate constant (k) provide a strong clue. The units are mol/L/s (or M/s), which correspond to the units of rate itself. This indicates that the reaction is likely **zero-order** with respect to \\(NH_3\\), meaning Rate = \\(k[NH_3]^0 = k\\).\nThe integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is: \\([A]_t = -kt + [A]_0\\), where \\([A]_t\\) is the concentration at time t, k is the rate constant, t is the time, and \\([A]_0\\) is the initial concentration.\nGiven: \\([NH_3]_0 = 0.800\\ mol/L\\), \\(k = 2.66 \\times 10^{-4}\\ mol/L/s\\), and \\(t = 5\\ mins = 5 \\times 60 = 300\\ s\\).\nSubstitute the values: \\([NH_3]_{300s} = -(2.66 \\times 10^{-4}\\ mol/L/s) \\times (300\\ s) + 0.800\\ mol/L\\).\n\\([NH_3]_{300s} = -0.0798\\ mol/L + 0.800\\ mol/L\\).\n\\([NH_3]_{300s} = 0.7202\\ mol/L\\).\nRounding to three significant figures, the amount left is 0.720 mol/L. This calculation relies on the assumption of a zero-order reaction based on the units provided for the rate constant."

Conjugate base \\(ClO_4^-\\) has charge delocalized over four oxygens.\nAlternatively, consider the inductive effect: as the number of electronegative oxygen atoms bonded to the central chlorine atom increases, more electron density is pulled away from the O-H bond. This weakens the O-H bond, making it easier for the proton (H⁺) to dissociate, thus increasing the acid strength. Therefore, the acid strength increases with the number of oxygen atoms (or the oxidation state of chlorine). The correct order of increasing acid strength is: \\(HOCl < HClO_2 < HClO_3 < HClO_4\\)."
