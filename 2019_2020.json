    },
    "Explanation": {
      "type": "string",
      "content": "In first-order reactions, the rate of reaction depends only on the concentration of one reactant raised to the first power. The characteristic feature is that the half-life of a first-order reaction is constant and independent of the initial concentration. This is because the rate equation is: rate = k[A], where k is the rate constant and [A] is the concentration of the reactant. The integrated rate law for first-order reactions is ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]₀, showing that the time dependence is logarithmic and doesn't involve initial concentration in determining the reaction order."

    "Explanation": {
      "type": "string",
      "content": "Homogeneous catalysts exist in the same phase (gas, liquid, or solid) as the reactants. They work by forming intermediate complexes with reactants that lower the activation energy of the reaction. A classic example is acid catalysis where H⁺ ions in solution catalyze reactions. This differs from heterogeneous catalysis where the catalyst is in a different phase (e.g., solid catalyst for gaseous reactants). Homogeneous catalysis often provides better selectivity but can be harder to separate from products."

Mathematically: rate of NO decomposition = 3 × (rate of N₂O formation) = 3 × 0.042 mol/L·s = 0.126 mol/L·s.

      "type": "string",
      "content": "For the reaction A + 2B → 2C, the rates are related by the stoichiometric coefficients. The correct relationship is: the rate of disappearance of A (-d[A]/dt) equals half the rate of disappearance of B (-½d[B]/dt) equals half the rate of appearance of C (½d[C]/dt). This maintains the 1:2:2 stoichiometric ratio. The negative signs indicate consumption of reactants, while the positive sign would indicate product formation. This relationship ensures the reaction rate is uniquely defined regardless of which species is measured."

For example: increasing reactant concentration shifts equilibrium toward products; increasing pressure shifts toward the side with fewer gas moles; increasing temperature shifts to absorb heat (endothermic direction). This principle is fundamental in predicting how equilibrium systems respond to disturbances and is widely used in industrial process optimization."

Then multiply the HI formation reaction by 3: 3H₂(g) + 3I₂(g) ⇌ 6HI(g) with Kₚ'' = (54.0)³. The overall Kₚ is the product: Kₚ = Kₚ' × Kₚ'' = (6.10 × 10⁻⁵) × (1.57 × 10⁵) ≈ 1.18 × 10⁻⁵.

Kb = x²/(0.5-x) ≈ x²/0.5 (assuming x << 0.5). Solving: x = [OH⁻] = √(0.5 × 4.38 × 10⁻⁴) ≈ 0.015 M. Thus [CH₃NH₂] ≈ 0.5 - 0.015 ≈ 0.485 M. The approximation is valid (3% dissociation). This shows typical weak base behavior with partial dissociation."

      "content": "Cr²⁺ (oxidation state +2) loses an electron to become Cr³⁺ (+3), showing oxidation. MnO₂'s Mn (+4) gains electrons to become Mn²⁺ (+2), undergoing reduction. The oxidation half-reaction is Cr²⁺ → Cr³⁺ + e⁻. This redox process couples chromium's oxidation with manganese's reduction, with H⁺ providing the acidic medium necessary for MnO₂ reduction. The identification of oxidized species is fundamental to balancing redox equations."

This definition complements reducing agents (electron donors) and is crucial for understanding electrochemical cells, corrosion, and metabolic processes. The term 'oxidant' persists even when oxygen isn't involved, reflecting historical origins in combustion studies."

This quantifies Michael Faraday's observation that electrolysis products are stoichiometrically related to current × time.

The fraction of effective collisions determines reaction rate according to collision theory. Factors like temperature (increases energy) and catalysts (lowers Eₐ) increase effectiveness. This concept explains why reaction rates are much slower than total collision frequencies in gases (~1 in 10¹³ collisions are effective for typical reactions)."
